# JourneyToCode

Welcome to **JourneyToCode** repository! This is where I document my web development learning process, showcase my progress, and present mini projects, practice projects, and major projects using different technologies and frameworks. Each project is a step on my journey to becoming a proficient full-stack developer.

## About the Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my learning and growth in web development. It includes:

- **Mini Projects**: Short projects to explore and practice a specific technology or concept.
- **Practice Projects**: Projects that combine various technologies and concepts to build a functional solution.
- **Major Projects**: Large-scale, full-stack applications that showcase the integration of multiple technologies and demonstrate my skills.

### Goals
- Learn and master a wide range of web development technologies and frameworks.
- Build a diverse portfolio of small, medium, and large projects to demonstrate my skills.
- Share challenges, solutions, and insights to help others in their development journey.
- Continuously update this repository with new projects, techniques, and learnings.

### Technologies/Frameworks
The repository will contain projects using these technologies, with more added as I progress:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Other Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code, npm/yarn, Docker, and more

### Progress Tracking
I will use GitHub Issues and Projects to track my progress, set goals, and document each project. This will help organize the learning journey, from day-to-day updates to long-term milestones.

### How to Contribute
I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions! If you have any insights, improvements, or ideas for future projects, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
